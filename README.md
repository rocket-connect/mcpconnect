Comprehensive TypeScript definitions ensure type safety across the entire MCP protocol with dedicated schemas for chat conversations and tool execution tracking.

## Configuration Guide

### MCP Server Connection

Navigate to the connection management interface and configure your server endpoint using any supported protocol (http://, https://, ws://, wss://). Set the appropriate authentication parameters including Bearer tokens, API keys, or Basic authentication credentials. Test the connection to verify functionality and confirm that tools are properly discovered. Enable the specific tools required for your testing workflow through the visual interface.

### AI Provider Setup

Access the settings panel from the application header and configure your AI provider credentials for either Anthropic Claude or OpenAI models. Select your preferred model and adjust generation parameters including temperature, token limits, and streaming preferences. Validate API connectivity through the built-in testing function and configure streaming settings based on your development requirements.

## Use Cases

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

Verify that your MCP server is accessible and properly configured for CORS if running in a browser environment. Confirm that authentication credentials are correct and have appropriate permissions for the tools you're attempting to access. Test with HTTP endpoints before attempting WebSocket or Server-Sent Events protocols, and check for network connectivity issues or firewall restrictions that might block the connection.

### Tool Execution Problems

Validate that tool parameters match the expected schema defined by your MCP server implementation. Review the tool enablement status in the sidebar interface to ensure required tools are active for your conversation. Analyze detailed execution logs available in the inspector panel to identify specific failure points, and verify that your AI provider is properly configured with valid API credentials and sufficient usage limits.

### Performance Issues

Monitor browser memory usage during extended development sessions and clear conversation history periodically to maintain optimal performance. Adjust streaming settings based on your network conditions and connection stability. Use the export functionality to archive older conversations and free up browser storage space for active development work.
